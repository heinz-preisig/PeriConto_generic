# What one can do with the periconto?

    Currently it allows:
         1. load an existing ontlogy (<name>.trig)
            or create a new ontology -- it will ask for file <name>
            starts a new tree with the root named root
         2. chose an existing sample ontology. 
            asks for input file
         3. one can:
                . add items to a class
                . link a class to an item in a class
                    . either define a new class
                    . or choose an existing class
                . add a primitive to a class or a subclass
                    . primitives are integer, string, comment, decimal, uri
                . items and primitives can be renamed (double click on name)
                . unlink items from a class
                . remove items, primitives and unused classes

    Not (yet) implented:
        1. renaming classes
        2. handling of elucidations
